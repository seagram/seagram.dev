In 2005, Steve Jobs unveiled to the world the first iPod nano. It was an impossibly small MP3 player and to illustrate this, while on stage Jobs famously asked the crowd _"Ever wonder what this pocket is for?"_, pointing to the coin pocket on his jeans. He reached into the pocket and while pulling something out of it, he said "Well... now we know because this is the iPod Nano."

The rest was history.

Explain how form factor impacts user interaction. Explain the "Shuffle Songs" menu item on the home screen. Explain how that then forced the shuffle to be better and thus a new one had to be made.

Alongside it, Apple introduced some new features to iTunes. One of which was "Smart Shuffle". Apple's solution to a common iTunes complaint: the "shuffle" mode isn't random enough. Users noticed the mode often played the same artist (or even album) back-to-back-to-back. The fix was an algorithm that weighted certain metrics like the last artist played to determine which song to play next. The result was an experience that seemed more random while mathematically being much less so. But users loved it. So much so, Apple adopted this Smart Shuffle as the new default shuffle mode. 20 years later and the shuffle in Apple Music uses an weighted algorithm just like before.

But why? Why does something _less_ random _feel_ more random? One reason could be the Gambler's fallacy.
Imagine you're at the casino playing roulette. The last 5 rounds have all landed on red. Huh? I guess the next round must land on black. I mean, what are the chances of _6_ reds in a row? Well, the same as 5 reds and 1 black. Each round is an independent of each other and both red and black have even odds of 48.65%.

But we're humans. We identify patterns in complete random things. From those patterns, we theorize certain outcomes are destined to happen. That's the Gambler's fallacy. When playing our music on shuffle, we don't take notice of different artist playing after each other. It's only when the same artist is played again that we raise an eyebrow. Yet both events are equally likely to happen in a purely random algorithm.

Let's go back to roulette. In 1913, a game of roulette at the Monte Carlo Casino landed on black 26 times in a row. That's ridiculous. Even more so when you consider the odds. 1 in 68.4 million. Legend says gamblers kept betting against black. Millions of francs were lost. All because of the Gambler's fallacy.

The list of examples go on. Baseball umpires are 1.3% less likely to call a strike if the previous two balls were strikes as well. Loan officers are 8% less likely to approve a loan if they approved their last client. Put simply, it's the law of small numbers. We deluded ourselves into believe a small sample group is representative of the greater whole. Yes, the odds of flipping a coin heads is 1/2. ...
